### Examples
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to apply for adoption and get notified of updates.
- **Tasks:** Design form, set up model, build view, add email confirmation (if applicable)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Can apply, view status, reapply restriction enforced

All user stories are mapped to project goals and documented in GitHub issues.

## Introduction
 The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the website operates as expected and provides a secure, efficient, user-friendly experience.

## Automated Testing
### Django Tests
#### Models
- **Cat Model Test:**
  - Purpose: Ensure the cat model stores all necessary data correctly.
  - Method: Create a cat instance and verify each field.
  
#### Forms
- **Adoption Form Test:**
  - Purpose: Check the adoption form validation and data handling.
  - Method: Submit the form with both valid and invalid data.

#### Views
- **Login Required Test:**
  - Purpose: Confirm that pages requiring a login cannot be accessed anonymously.
  - Method: Access the URLs without logging in and expect a redirect to the login page.

### Integration Testing
- **User Flow Test:**
  - Purpose: Simulate a user's action from logging in to adopting a cat.
  - Method: Use Selenium to test a series of actions performed by the user.

## Manual Testing
### Navigation
- **Links:**
  - All navigation links are tested to ensure they point to the correct pages.

### Forms
- **Adoption Application:**
  - Test each field for validation rules and check the submission process.
  
## Usability Testing
- **User Feedback:**
  - Collect feedback from a group of users to identify any usability issues.

## Accessibility Testing
- **Screen Reader Tests:**
  - Use tools like NVDA and VoiceOver to test accessibility.
- **Color Contrast:**
  - Verify that text is readable and elements are distinguishable.

## Responsive Testing
- **Device Testing:**
  - Test the website on various devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop) to ensure layouts adapt correctly.

## Performance Testing
- **Load Time:**
  - Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to test and optimize the load time.

### Bugs
- **Resolved:** Local images not displaying (fixed media file path and settings)
- **Resolved:** Admin redirect logic from login
- **Known:** None at time of submission


## üöß Deployment

### Steps
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set `DEBUG=False` and configure `.env`
3. Use Cloudinary for media
4. Push to Heroku Git or connect to GitHub repo

### Files
- `Procfile`
- `requirements.txt`
- `.env`
- `.gitignore`

### Security
- `SECRET_KEY`, `DB`, `DEBUG` are hidden in `.env`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` set for Heroku
