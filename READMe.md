- **Tasks:** Design form, set up model, build view, add email confirmation (if applicable)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Can apply, view status, reapply restriction enforced

All user stories are mapped to project goals and documented in GitHub issues.

## Introduction
 The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the website operates as expected and provides a secure, efficient, user-friendly experience.

## Automated Testing
### Django Tests
#### Models
- **Cat Model Test:**
  - Purpose: Ensure the cat model stores all necessary data correctly.
  - Method: Create a cat instance and verify each field.
  
#### Forms
- **Adoption Form Test:**
  - Purpose: Check the adoption form validation and data handling.
  - Method: Submit the form with both valid and invalid data.

#### Views
- **Login Required Test:**
  - Purpose: Confirm that pages requiring a login cannot be accessed anonymously.
  - Method: Access the URLs without logging in and expect a redirect to the login page.

### Integration Testing
- **User Flow Test:**
  - Purpose: Simulate a user's action from logging in to adopting a cat.
  - Method: Use Selenium to test a series of actions performed by the user.

## Manual Testing
### Navigation
- **Links:**
  - All navigation links are tested to ensure they point to the correct pages.

### Forms
- **Adoption Application:**
  - Test each field for validation rules and check the submission process.

## üöÄ Deployment

Follow these exact steps to deploy Kitty Connect on Heroku. 
---

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
# 1. Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/wafia7510/kitty-connect.git
cd kittyconnect

# 2. Create & activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
.\.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. Create Your `.env` File

In the project root, create a file named `.env` (do **not** commit it). Add exactly:

```dotenv
# Your Django secret key
SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key

# Must be False in production
DEBUG=False

# Comma-separated domains your app will serve
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app.herokuapp.com,localhost,127.0.0.1

# Use SQLite in production
DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.sqlite3
DATABASE_NAME=db.sqlite3
```

---

### 3. Procfile & Python Runtime

Create these two files in your repo root:

- **Procfile**  
  ```text
  web: gunicorn kittyconnect.wsgi
  ```  
  _(Tells Heroku to use Gunicorn to serve your app)_

- **runtime.txt**  
  ```text
  python-3.10.12
  ```  
  _(Pins Python version on Heroku)_

---

### 4. Create & Configure Your Heroku App

```bash
# 1. Create a new Heroku app
heroku create your-app-name

# 2. Push your code to Heroku
git push heroku main

# 3. Copy your .env values into Heroku‚Äôs config
heroku config:set \
  SECRET_KEY=$(grep SECRET_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2) \
  DEBUG=False \
  ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app.herokuapp.com,localhost,127.0.0.1 \
  
```

> Alternatively, go to your Heroku Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Config Vars and add each key/value manually.

---

### 5. Run Migrations & Collect Static Files

```bash
# Apply database migrations
heroku run python manage.py migrate

```

---

### 6. Verify Your Live Site

1. Open your app:  
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```
2. Tail the logs for errors:  
   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail
   ```
3. Check that:
   - Your CSS and JavaScript load correctly.
   - Login, browsing cats, making adoption requests all work.
   - There are no ‚ÄúDisallowedHost‚Äù or 500 errors.
